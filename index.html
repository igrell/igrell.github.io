While on a few day&#39;s visit at my friend&#39;s house in a beautiful small city in the Kashubia region of Poland; city&#39;s by the lake, and the house&#39;s terrace opens right up on it. These few days we could spend the afternoons sitting side by side, with the sun reflected from the lake glittering delicately on our books as we read in a mutually comfortable silence. I noticed reading with another person, in opposition to studying or doing other solo activities, enables me to focus much better on the activity itself &#40;albeit interrupted by my inescapable need of providing anecdotes on various topics or of commenting on a particularly gripping fragment I&#39;m just reading&#41;. It really is a profound feeling, to be able to enjoy being together solely with a work of literature &#40;and in turn, of course, with oneself&#39;s mind&#39;s reflection of that work&#41; while at the same time sharing a moment of mutuality.</p> <p>By the way, the book I&#39;ve been reading then is <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/136613048-six-stars-with-a-crooked-neck">Six Stars with a Crooked Neck</a></em> by Pema Bhum - an amazingly beautifully crafted account of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in Tibet, by a contemporary Tibetan author who has fled the country in need of preserving the Tibetan literature and culture violently supressed by the CCP. I&#39;ve read it in Polish &#40;<em><a href="https://piw.pl/historia/332-opowiadania-o-rewolucji-kulturalnej-w-tybecie-9788381960397.html">Opowiadania o rewolucji kulturalnej w Tybecie</a></em>, PIW 2020&#41; and am not sure if the selection chosen for the Polish translation has been exactly the same in the English version. Moreover, Polish edition was actually a double translation from English, which usually I&#39;d think of as too much, but I must say that this time the final result was quite splendid. All in all the short stories included are extraordinary pieces and I thoroughlly reccommend it.</p> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Igor Piechowiak.

# Reading with friends
##### 28 July 2024
    Lately I've been once again reminded what an important and delightful
    activity reading together with friends is for me. While on a few day's
    visit at my friend's house in a beautiful small city in the Kashubia region
    of Poland; city's by the lake, and the house's terrace opens right up on
    it. These few days we could spend the afternoons sitting side by side, with
    the sun reflected from the lake glittering delicately on our books as we
    read in a mutually comfortable silence. I noticed reading with another
    person, in opposition to studying or doing other solo activities, enables
    me to focus much better on the activity itself (albeit interrupted by my
    inescapable need of providing anecdotes on various topics or of commenting
    on a particularly gripping fragment I'm just reading). It really is a
    profound feeling, to be able to enjoy being together solely with a work of
    literature (and in turn, of course, with oneself's mind's reflection of
    that work) while at the same time sharing a moment of mutuality.
By the way, the book I've been reading then is 
*[Six Stars with a Crooked Neck](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/136613048-six-stars-with-a-crooked-neck)*
by Pema Bhum - an amazingly beautifully crafted account of the Chinese Cultural
Revolution in Tibet, by a contemporary Tibetan author who has fled the country
in need of preserving the Tibetan literature and culture violently supressed by
the CCP. I've read it in Polish (*[Opowiadania o rewolucji kulturalnej w
Tybecie](https://piw.pl/historia/332-opowiadania-o-rewolucji-kulturalnej-w-tybecie-9788381960397.html)*, PIW 2020) and am not sure if the selection chosen for the Polish
translation has been exactly the same in the English version. Moreover, Polish
edition was actually a double translation from English, which usually I'd think
of as too much, but I must say that this time the final result was quite
splendid. All in all the short stories included are extraordinary pieces and I
thoroughlly reccommend it.
